This prototype web application—Ecosystem Service Equalizer—is designed to explore trade-offs and synergies between forest ecosystem services under different forest management regimes. It provides an interactive tool for visualizing how timber production impacts other ecosystem services such as climate control, habitat maintenance, water regulation, and recreation, depending on the selected harvest strategy and managed area.
